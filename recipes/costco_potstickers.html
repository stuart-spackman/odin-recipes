    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I like these postickers so much that there's been several occasions where I ate the entire bag in one sitting.
        I used to have a Saturday ritual where I would do an hour long gi jiu jitsu class, an hour long boxing class,
        and an hour long no gi jiu jitsu class.
        Then I would come home and eat an entire bag of these potstickers.
        Maybe someday I'll be able to do that again, but the past couple times I attempted it I failed.
        Look up the weight of the bag these potstickers come in at your own risk!

    <h2>Description</h2>
    I have a really fond memory involving this chili. I discovered this recipe when I was in gradudate school and it
    marked
    one of the first occasions where I was capable of becoming my own chef. The funny part of this story is that I
    didn't know what a clove of garlic was.
    I thought that meant the entire head of garlic. So the first time I made this chili I put in
    two entire heads of garlic. And it still tastted awesome.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>One 8-ounce can tomato sauce
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
        </li>
        <li>1/4 cup masa harina
        </li>
        <li>One 15-ounce can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
        </li>
        <li>One 15-ounce can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
        </li>
        <li>Lime wedges, for serving
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the ground beef in a large pot and throw in the garlic. Cook over medium heat until browned. Drain off
            the excess fat, and then pour in the tomato sauce, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and cayenne. Stir
            together well, cover, and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. If the
            mixture becomes overly dry, add 1/2 cup water at a time as needed.
        </li>
        <li>After an hour, place the masa harina in a small bowl. Add 1/2 cup water and stir together with a fork. Dump
            the masa mixture into the chili. Stir together well, and then taste and adjust the seasonings. Add more masa
            paste and/or water to get the chili to your preferred consistency, or to add more corn flavor. Add the beans
            and simmer for 10 minutes. Serve with shredded Cheddar, chopped onions, tortilla chips and lime wedges.
        </li>
    </ol>

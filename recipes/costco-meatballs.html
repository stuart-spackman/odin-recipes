    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="container top">
        Taken from the Costco Cuisine site: "Meatballs are a really versatile food made of ground meat rolled into a
        ball! These Costco Kirkland Signature Italian Style Beef Meatballs are done in minutes and can be added to a
        variety of different dishes. Are these meatballs from Costco worth picking up? Or will you regret having this
        six-pound bag of 140 meatballs in your freezer?""

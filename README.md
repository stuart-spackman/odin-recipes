For now I am making an attempt at doing this HTML project just off of the skills I developed from Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp. I plan on coming back to make this project much better after properly studying The Odin Project's lessons. 

On second thought!

Turns out I had all the skills I needed from Colt Steele's bootcamp. 
I didn't have to consult any of the Odin Project's HTML lesson plans. But I still plan on reading through them to get my fundamental understandings strong.
